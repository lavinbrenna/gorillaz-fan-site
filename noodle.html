    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p class="boxes">
      Noodle was born in Osaka, Kansai, Japan on October 31, 1990. She spent a portion of her childhood in Japan as a subject of a classified Japanese super soldier project under the management of the Japanese scientist, Mr. Kyuzo.

      Noodle and twenty-two other children were trained for the sole purpose of fighting as soldiers for the Japanese military and government. After the children were deemed too dangerous and unstable for combat, the project was scrapped. Mr. Kyuzo was then ordered to dispose of all possible traces of the failed experiment, as well as its participants.[1] Kyuzo killed the twenty-two child soldiers, but was still reluctant to kill Noodle. Deciding to spare her, Kyuzo placed her in a state of amnesia through the use of verbal commands. The phrase used to place Noodle in her state of amnesia was "Ocean Bacon." After temporarily clearing her memory of the project, Kyuzo smuggled Noodle to the United Kingdom in a FedEx crate and falsely reported her death to his superiors.

      Noodle arrived at the doorstep of Kong Studios in 1998, in a FedEx crate. Once the crate was taken inside, Noodle sprung out of the box and performed a guitar solo (which 2-D described as being "brilliant" as well as sounding like "200 demons screaming in Arabic"). She ended her solo with a twenty-foot high karate kick and saying a few words in Japanese before bowing and saying the word "noodle." This earned her the name "Noodle" (her only currently known name) and a spot in the band as lead guitarist (replacing Paula Cracker).[2]

      <h2>Early Gorillaz</h2>
      <p class="boxes">
        Noodle was about ten years old in this phase. She mainly played the guitar, but also provided vocals for the Gorillaz, most notably the track "19-2000." In numerous idents and music videos alike, it became obvious that Noodle was talented at much more than just music. She is also proficient at martial arts. During this phase, she couldn't speak English, except for a few phrases including "yeah" and "duh" (apparently she could also say "she turned my dad on" and "get the cool shoeshine" as seen in the "5/4" storyboard and the "19-2000" music video, respectively).
